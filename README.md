|----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `+`      | Addition                                | `5 + 3 = 8`        |
| `-`      | Subtraction                             | `10 - 6 = 4`       |
| `*` or `×` | Multiplication                        | `4 × 2 = 8`        |
| `/` or `÷` | Division                              | `8 ÷ 2 = 4`        |

| `C`      | Clear/reset the input                   | Clears the screen  |
| `=`      | Calculate the entered expression        | -                  |
| `%`      | **Percentage logic** – calculates percentage based on the next number | `10%100 = 10` (means 10% of 100) |

> Example: `100 + 10%200` will be interpreted as `100 + (200 × 10 ÷ 100)` = `120`.
